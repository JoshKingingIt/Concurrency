# Building and testing the application

Run gradle from the root directory (DataStructures)
$ ./gradlew

From the root directory run 
$ bin/test_data_structures

This will give the usage. An example of a correct run of the application is:
$ bin/test_data_structures cgl
(which would test your course-grained list implementation).


# Running the application

From the root directory run 
$ bin/run_data_structures

This will give the usage. An example of a correct run of the application is:
$ bin/run_data_structures cgl 2 10000 10

The first argument indicates the version to use, the second argument is the number of worker threads,
the third argument is the number of items to add, and the fourth argument is the number of
microseconds that the program should do work per item upon removing them ("work" in
the sense of Amdahl's law, as the actual work performed is artificial in this application).


# Creating a submission

First put the pdf-file containing your report in the "report" directory. Then call
$ ./gradlew submit
This should create a "submit.zip" file that you can submit on Canvas.
